# Airport Database 

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate foundational knowledge of SQL queries. This project focuses on using the basic SQL clauses: `SELECT`, `FROM`, and `WHERE`. By mastering these clauses, you will be able to retrieve specific data from a database and build a solid understanding of SQL.

## SQL Clauses Covered

- **SELECT**: Used to specify which fields you want to retrieve.
- **FROM**: Used to specify the tables from which you want to retrieve the data.
- **WHERE**: Used to filter the rows based on certain conditions.

## Tasks

Below are the SQL queries designed based on the `lyrics.sql` schema:

1. **List the Title, UPC, and Genre of all CD titles.**
   - **Table**: Titles

2. **List all of the information of CD(s) produced by the artist whose ArtistID is 2.**
   - **Table**: Titles

3. **List the First Name, Last Name, HomePhone, and Email address of all members.**
   - **Table**: Members

4. **List the Member ID of all male members.**

6. **List the first name, last name, and region of all members from Virginia who either have a work phone or an email address.**
   - **Table**: Members

## How to Run

1. Load the `lyrics.sql` schema into your SQL environment.
2. Execute the SQL queries based on the tasks listed above.
3. Verify the output by comparing it with the expected results.

## Conclusion

This project serves as an introductory exercise in SQL query formulation. By completing the tasks, you will have a better understanding of how to extract specific data from a database using basic SQL commands.
